# asciidash
my geometry dash clone I made in 2 hours with ncurses

syntax:
   ./asciidash <level name>
depends on:
    ncurses (install the devel version, ncurses-devel in xbps but most of you use apt, so idk)
level format:
    just look at the example level, make sure to turn off line wrapping in your text editor

run 'make run' to run the example level
